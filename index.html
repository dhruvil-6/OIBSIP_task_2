                <p class="p1">
                     Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam (15 October 1931 to 27 July 2015) was an Indian
                    aerospace scientist who served as the 13th President of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and
                    raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next
                    four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and
                    Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately
                    involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile development efforts. He thus came
                    to be known as the <em><b>'Missile Man of India'</b></em> for his work on the development of
                    ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology. He also played a pivotal organisational, technical,
                    and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear
                    test by India in 1974.

                <p class="p2">
                    Kalam was elected as the 11th president of India in 2002 with the support of both the ruling
                    Bharatiya Janata Party and the then-opposition Indian National Congress. Widely referred to as the
                    <em><strong>"People's President"</strong></em>, he returned to his civilian life of education,
                    writing and public service after a single term. He was a recipient of several prestigious awards,
                    including the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour.

                    While delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong, Kalam collapsed and died
                    from an apparent cardiac arrest on 27 July 2015, aged 83. Thousands, including national-level
                    dignitaries, attended the funeral ceremony held in his hometown of Rameswaram, where he was buried
                    with full state honours.

                    After graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960, Kalam joined the Aeronautical
                    Development Establishment of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (by Press Information
                    Bureau, Government of India) as a scientist after becoming a member of the Defence Research &
                    Development Service (DRDS). He started his career by designing a small hovercraft, but remained
                    unconvinced by his choice of a job at DRDO. Kalam was also part of the INCOSPAR committee working
                    under Vikram Sarabhai, the renowned space scientist. In 1969, Kalam was transferred to the Indian
                    Space Research Organisation (ISRO) where he was the project director of India's first Satellite
                    Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) which successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in near-earth orbit in
                    July 1980; Kalam had first started work on an expandable rocket project independently at DRDO in
                    1965.
                    In 1969, Kalam received the government's approval and expanded the programme to include more
                    engineers.
